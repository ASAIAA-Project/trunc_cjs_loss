# CJS Loss on Truncated Normal Distribution

## notes

- [Truncated normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_normal_distribution)
- Cumulative truncated normal [post](https://www.quora.com/How-can-one-restrict-the-cumulative-distribution-function-of-a-truncated-normal-in-such-a-way-that-the-resulting-probability-mass-function-is-the-same-with-the-one-resulting-from-solving-the-system-described) [git](https://github.com/toshas/torch_truncnorm/blob/main/TruncatedNormal.py)
- Cumulative Jensen-Shannon Divergence
- get explicit form of cumulative truncated normal distribution [x]
- use discrete bins to approximate
