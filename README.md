# CJS Loss on Truncated Normal Distribution

## notes

- [Truncated normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_normal_distribution)
- Cumulative Jensen-Shannon Divergence
- Predicting Aesthetic Score Distribution through Cumulative Jensen-Shannon Divergence
- get explicit form of cumulative truncated normal distribution [x]
- use discrete bins to approximate
